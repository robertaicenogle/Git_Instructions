Instructions for Github and Gitbash

### Creating a branch in Github
Follow these steps to create a branch:

- Navigate to the repository folder on your computer.
- In Terminal on macOS or Git Bash on Windows, type git pull or git pull origin main and press Enter.
- Type git checkout -b Simple_Leaflet_Map and press Enter.
- git checkout lets us navigate between branches.
- -b indicates we are creating a new branch.
- The name of the new branch follows -b.
- After pressing Enter, your terminal or Git Bash should return the following: Switched to a new branch 'Simple_Leaflet_Map'
- Now we are in the Simple_Leaflet_Map branch. Confirm this by typing git branch and pressing Enter. The output in Terminal or Git Bash should look as follows, with an asterisk next to the branch name:

- * Simple_Leaflet_Map
  main
- At this point, the folder structure on your computer hasn't changed. The files you had in your main branch are now in your Simple_Leaflet_Map branch.
